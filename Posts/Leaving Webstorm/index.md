I wanted to summarize which Webstorm features I'm not using, but after 1 hour I got so tired.
Webstorm has so many options that my option is to leave it.

## Code style

![](assets/49936ed380126efb.png)  

Replaced by:  

* editorconfig for general code style  

* JSHint

* Coffeelint

## Compass support

![](assets/43008733f03e2a32.png)  

Never used.

## Coverage

![](assets/f87f5d83e9d63623.png)  

Never used.

## Dart

![](assets/dd990b1fec23cae1.png)  

Never used.

## Deployment

![](assets/11b61e5b825014e3.png)  

Github + Jenkins instead.

## Directories

![](assets/8fb6f2eef583c279.png)  

Useful to ignore libraries folders (node_modules, bower_components) and generated stuff (by Grunt).

But settings was hard to override if I needed to check for something in these folders.

## File Colors

![](assets/4920bf63b6d93c4c.png)  

Never used.

## File encoding

![](assets/8b520e219bc30ba7.png)  

Never used. Used UTF-8 for everything

## File Watchers  

![](assets/49cbb3839ee1cbde.png)  

Replaced by Grunt & Watch combination

## Inspections

![](assets/5de3426c74452e03.png)  

Partially replaced by JSHint

## Javascript

![](assets/9ea8a4214c5515a3.png)

Useful, but not perfect

## Language Injections

![](assets/42c7a5e795ed34fb.png)  

Useful, but used only few times and using templates compiled on built step is better practice.

## Node.js and NPM

![](assets/65aec812875c6b33.png)  

Never noticed.

## Schemas and DTDs

![](assets/c448b8558f63f990.png)  

Never used.

![](assets/8d43d41adab1f994.png)  

Never used.

Replaced by system spelling checker.  

## Tasks  

![](assets/71b9655e381613d6.png)  

Nice, especially with JIRA. But still prefer web app.

## Template Data Languages  

![](assets/f3a6a5df02e33e3b.png)  

Never used.

## Terminal  

![](assets/98f7af1df51cff6b.png)  

Super, but iTerm was always a little bit better.

## Version Control  

![](assets/05149d22e5c3301d.png)  

Nice, but never fully used and switched to Sourcetree instead.

## XSLT File Associations

![](assets/18c0e33e7ed2b3f8.png)  

Used only in school.

## Angular

Never noticed.

## Appearance

![](assets/381fa9018995e260.png)  

Even after looong customizing, never so sexy like Sublime/Textmate.

## Debugger  

![](assets/6fdcae3bc429ab1a.png)  

Great in theory, always causing trouble in practice.

In Javascript world, nothing can be better than Chrome.

## Editor  

![](assets/457b6c7891b93ce2.png)  

## Emmet

Nice, but can be used as plugin in almost every editor.

## External Diff Tools  

![](assets/a00bef25245584bd.png)  

Never used.

## External Tools  

![](assets/b6741d05a71334d9.png)  

Never used.

## File and Code Templates  

![](assets/32d03380e290c2b8.png)  

Nice, but I want to use it everywhere.

## File Types  

![](assets/da0bdc72d8c5c50a.png)  

Standard stuff, complicated settings.

## General  

![](assets/9306c328a124c07e.png)

Always hated that IDE is trying open images.

## Intentions  

![](assets/19d1e13ff6317200.png)  

Useful.

## Keymap  

![](assets/c688c2a0db085c40.png)  

After spending a lot of time, it becomes rather useful.

But always feels like a not a native app.

Never used.

## Live Templates  

![](assets/8aeb18d7301373e8.png)  

Nice, but more useful at system level.

Useful

## Passwords  

Not useful.
